> Haii, I'm Fawaz. Just another ordinary kid who sits at his laptop trying to build kewl stuff for fun. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

I build stuff mostly with python and sometimes for the web. Most of my projects are really dumb and useless but I hope one day that the stuff that I have built will be of use/help to someone around the world and that they would genuinely enjoy using it.

- Currently pursuing my bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering.
- I kinda self-taught myself to code soo I suck at it, lol.
- I don't wanna restrict myself to a specific domain. So I learn whatever I like. Instead of being good at one domain, now I'm bad at multiple domains. ( gg I played myself )
- I love to code, watch anime, and play games.
- I'm good at googling.
- Love to learn more.
