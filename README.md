> Haii, I'm Fawaz. Just another kid who sits at his laptop truying to build kewl stuff for fun. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

I build stuff mostly with python and sometimes for the web. Most of my projects are really dumb and useless ( I enjoy building it so why not lol. ) but I hope one day the stuff that I have built will be of use/help to someone around the world and that they would genuinely enjoy using it.


- Currently pursuing my bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering.
- I kinda self thought myself to code soo I suck at it yeah lol.
- I dont wanna restrict myself to a specific domain. So I learn whatever I like and instead of being good at one specific domain I'm now bad at many different domains. ( gg I played myself )
- I love to code, watch anime and play games.
- I'm good at googling.
